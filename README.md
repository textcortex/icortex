ICortex is a no-code development framework that lets you to develop Python programs using plain English. Simply create a recipe that breaks down step-by-step what you want to do in plain English. Our code generating AI will follow your instructions and develop a Python program that suits your needs.

## Try it out

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/textcortex/icortex-binder/HEAD?filepath=basic_example.ipynb)

You can try out ICortex directly in your browser. Launch a Binder instance by clicking [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/textcortex/icortex-binder/HEAD?filepath=basic_example.ipynb), and follow the [instructions in our docs](https://docs.icortex.ai/en/latest/quickstart.html#using-icortex) to get started.

Alternatively, you can use ICortex in Google Colab if you have an account. See [below](#on-google-colab).

[Check out the documentation](https://docs.icortex.ai/) to learn more. [Join our Discord](https://discord.textcortex.com/) to get help.

## Installation

### Locally

Install directly from PyPI:

```sh
pip install icortex
# This line is needed to install the kernel spec to Jupyter:
python -m icortex.kernel.install
```

### On Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a restricted computing environment that does not allow installing new Jupyter kernels. However, you can still use ICortex by running the following code in a Colab notebook:

```
!pip install icortex
import icortex.init
```

Note that the package needs to be installed to every new Google Colab runtimeâ€”you may need to reinstall if it ever gets disconnected.

## Quickstart

## Getting help

Feel free to ask questions in our [Discord](https://discord.textcortex.com/).

## Uninstalling

To uninstall, run

```bash
pip uninstall icortex
```

This removes the package, however, it may still leave the kernel spec in Jupyter's kernel directories, causing it to continue showing up in JupyterLab. If that is the case, run

```
jupyter kernelspec uninstall icortex -y
```
